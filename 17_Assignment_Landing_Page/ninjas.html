<h1>Shinobi was a job title</h1>

<p>Contrary to what many think, the shinobi were not poor peasants that were trained in the mountains and then hired to perform the sorts of missions no samurai would. The term shinobi no mono is in fact a job title, little different from “pikeman”, “carpenter”, “accountant” or “archer”. Shinobi were typically of samurai level but at minimum they were ashigaru or foot soldiers who specialized in covert operations, commando skills and spying. The shinobi should been seen as samurai or professional warriors hired by a lord to act as a covert operators team or spies.</p>

<h1>No black suits or throwing stars</h1>

<p>The black masked suit of the ninja enters the historical record in the period of peace after 1600. There is no historical evidence to show that ninja ever wore this garb; most documents point to shinobi wearing standard Japanese clothes of the time: white uniforms for full moons, black for darker nights and no mask or sword on the back. A ninja might use disguise when walking among the enemy, strong clothes and solid footwear when performing night raids and lighter less restricting attire when infiltrating houses – none of which would have included a mask. Furthermore, in all the shinobi documents left behind only one “ninja throwing star” is mentioned and even then it’s in reference to shinobi working in peacetime to apprehend criminals.</p>
