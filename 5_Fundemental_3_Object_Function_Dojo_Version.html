<h1>Javascript Assignment #3: Object (Dojo Version)</h1>
<script>

// Create a function that takes in one parameter called "name" and returns an object that looks similar to the person object from JS Fundamentals Part II.
// The returned object should have a name property that is set to the value of the name argument that was passed into the function.


function setName(name){
	person = { 
		name: name,
		distance_travelled: 0,
		say_name: function(){
		alert("hello " + person.name);
		},
		say_something: function(something){
			alert(something);
		},
		walk: function(){
			alert(person.name + " is walking.")
		},
		run: function(){
			alert(person.name + " is running.")
		},
		crawl: function(){
			alert(person.name + " is crawling.")
		}
	}
	return person
}

var object = setName("Andriana");
object.say_name();
person.say_something("Cool!");
person.walk();
person.run();
person.crawl();
console.log(object);

// Each returned person object should also have the following other properties (from JS Fundamentals Part II):
	// distance_travelled - set this initially as zero
	// say_name - should alert the object's name property
	// say_something - have it accept a parameter. It should then say for example "Jay says 'I am cool'" if you pass 'I am cool' as an argument to this method.
	// walk - have it alert for example "Jay is walking" and increase distance_travelled by 3
	// run - have it alert for example "Jay is running" and increase distance_travelled by 10
	// crawl - have it alert for example "Jay is crawling" and increase distance_travelled by 1
	// Note that in all of the above examples "Jay" is the placeholder for the object's name property.
	// Change the function name to "personConstructor"
	// If you have prior exposure to OOP, think about how this "constructor" function is similar to "classes"
	// If you don't have prior exposure to OOP, think about how this "constructor" function is being used to create many objects of similar types. It is acting as a blueprint for creating person objects.

// Now create a ninjaConstructor that can be used to create Ninjas that each have a name, cohort, and belt-level. Give all of the Ninjas a "levelUp" method that increases their belt-level (Have all ninjas start at a yellow-belt).


function NinjaGenerator(name){
	var ninja = {
		name: name,
		belt_level: 1,
		levelUp: function(){
			ninja.belt_level++;
		}
	}
	return ninja;
}

var newNinja = NinjaGenerator("Sensei");
newNinja.levelUp();
console.log(newNinja);
